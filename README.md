ORIPA: Origami Pattern Editor
=============================

ORIPA is a drawing software dedicated to designing the crease patterns of origami. The unique feature of ORIPA is calculation of the folded shape from the pattern.

The first version of ORIPA was released in 2005. ORIPA was made open source in 2012, and was pushed to Github in 2013.
